# Search Agent Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **WeaviateClient.__del__ Method Error**
   - Problem: The `__del__` method in the WeaviateClient class was trying to access `self._client` without checking if it exists.
   - Fix: Added a check to verify if the object has the `_client` attribute before calling the `close()` method.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/adapters/weaviate_adapter.py`

2. **Weaviate vs ChromaDB Usage in graph.py**
   - Problem: The graph.py file was importing and using Weaviate adapter even though the default config specifies ChromaDB.
   - Fix: Updated the import in graph.py to use the ChromaDB adapter instead of Weaviate.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/agent/graph.py`

3. **Error Message in Validator**
   - Problem: The error message in the validator.py file was specifically mentioning Weaviate.
   - Fix: Updated the error message to be database-agnostic.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/agent/nodes/validator.py`

4. **Weaviate vs ChromaDB Usage in facet_planner.py**
   - Problem: The facet_planner.py file was importing and using metadata_vectors from Weaviate.
   - Fix: Updated the import to use metadata_vectors_chroma instead.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/agent/nodes/facet_planner.py`

## Testing

1. **WebSocket Server Testing**
   - Created a test WebSocket client to verify the WebSocket server functionality.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/test_websocket_client.py`
   - Result: The WebSocket server is working correctly and responds to client messages.

2. **Search Agent Testing**
   - Created a test script to verify the search agent functionality with our fixes.
   - File: `/Users/jinjae/search_agent/test_search_agent.py`
   - Result: The search agent is now using ChromaDB instead of Weaviate, but there are no documents indexed in the database.

## Remaining Issues

1. **No Documents Indexed**
   - Problem: The ChromaDB database appears to be empty or not properly connected.
   - Possible Solution: Run the document ingestion process to populate the database.
   - Command: `python run.py --force-ingest`

2. **Facet Weights Error**
   - Problem: The facet_planner.py still has an error when trying to get facet weights.
   - Error: `Could not get facet weights: 'weaviate'`
   - Possible Solution: The error might be coming from a different part of the code that still references Weaviate.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration to ChromaDB**
   - The codebase still has references to Weaviate in various files. A complete migration to ChromaDB would involve:
     - Updating all imports to use ChromaDB adapters
     - Removing or refactoring Weaviate-specific code
     - Ensuring all database operations use ChromaDB

2. **Ingest Documents into ChromaDB**
   - Run the document ingestion process to populate the ChromaDB database.
   - This will allow the search agent to return actual results.

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more robust error handling for database connections and operations
   - Implement better logging for database operations

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the use of ChromaDB instead of Weaviate
