# Frontend Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Loading Animation

The loading animation has been updated to use a gradient soft glow effect:

- Replaced the simple "Thinking..." text with dots with a more elegant gradient animation
- The gradient smoothly flows from left to right, creating a soft glowing effect
- The animation is more subtle and professional, fitting the minimalist design

### 2. Fixed SSE Reception Issues

The Server-Sent Events (SSE) reception has been improved:

- Added support for both GET and POST requests to the `/api/query` endpoint
- Enhanced error handling in the frontend fetch request
- Improved the display of processing updates with staggered animations

### 3. Improved Processing Updates Display

The processing updates section has been enhanced:

- Added staggered fade-in animations for each update
- Ensured the processing updates container is always visible when it contains updates
- Improved styling for better readability

## Technical Details

### Loading Animation

The loading animation now uses CSS animations with a gradient overlay:

```css
.loading-indicator {
    display: inline-block;
    position: relative;
    width: 120px;
    height: 24px;
}

.loading-indicator:before {
    content: 'Thinking';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.loading-indicator:after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, 
        rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%, 
        rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 50%, 
        rgba(0,0,0,0) 100%);
    animation: gradient-glow 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

### SSE Endpoint Changes

The server now supports both GET and POST requests for the query endpoint:

```python
# Query endpoint - supports both POST and GET
@app.post("/api/query")
async def query_endpoint_post(request: QueryRequest):
    return await process_query(request)

@app.get("/api/query")
async def query_endpoint_get(query: str, query_id: Optional[str] = None, session_id: Optional[str] = None):
    request = QueryRequest(query=query, query_id=query_id, session_id=session_id)
    return await process_query(request)
```

### Processing Updates Animation

The processing updates now have staggered animations for a more dynamic feel:

```css
.processing-update {
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
    opacity: 0;
    animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease forwards;
}

.processing-update:nth-child(1) {
    animation-delay: 0s;
}

.processing-update:nth-child(2) {
    animation-delay: 0.2s;
}

.processing-update:nth-child(3) {
    animation-delay: 0.4s;
}
```

## How to Test

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Open the UI in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8001/
   ```

3. Enter a query and observe:
   - The new gradient glow loading animation
   - Real-time processing updates appearing with staggered animations
   - The smooth transition to the final answer
